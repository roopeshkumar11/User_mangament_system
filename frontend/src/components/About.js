            <p className="lead">
                Welcome to <strong>User Manager</strong> â€” a full-stack application built with <strong>React</strong> on the frontend
                and <strong>Flask</strong> on the backend. This project is designed to demonstrate seamless integration between a modern
                JavaScript UI and a Python REST API.
            </p>

            <p>
                With this app, you can easily create, update, and delete user records. All user data (Name, Email, Phone) is stored and
                managed through the Flask backend and displayed in real-time using React.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project is ideal for learning full-stack development principles, including:
                <ul>

                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Whether you're a student learning how front and back ends communicate, or a developer exploring Flask + React
                workflows, this app offers a clean, responsive experience to experiment with.
